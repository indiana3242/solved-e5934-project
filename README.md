In this project, you will explore the use of image gradients by applying it on the following<strong> three tasks</strong>:   o <strong>Adversarial Attack</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199">“Intriguing properties of neural networks”</a>

<ul>

 <li><strong>Class Visualization</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034">“Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification</a></li>

</ul>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034">Models and Saliency Maps”</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06579">“Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization”</a> o <strong>Style Transfer</strong><a href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf">:</a><a href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf"> “Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks”</a> <a href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf"> </a>

Please go through the above reference papers very carefully. You are expected to understand <strong>how to accomplish</strong> <strong>each task</strong> using the methods presented in the papers and<strong> write code to implement them</strong> by completing Project1.ipynb which is available in Project1.zip from LumiNUS.

Please<strong> take careful note</strong> of the following (failure to do so could incur penalties):  o your code<strong> MUST</strong> be kept within “TODO” and “END OF YOUR CODE”;

<ul>

 <li>do <strong>NOT </strong>modify the definitions of the functions in Project1.ipynb; o write “<strong>clean</strong>” (easily readable) code and check to make sure it runs/executes;</li>

 <li>do <strong>NOT</strong> <strong>share your solution code</strong> with others; <strong>submit your own work/code</strong>; there will be<strong> penalties for cheating</strong> and late submission.</li>

</ul>
